Social media websites are no longer performing an envisaged function of creating a positive communication link among friends, family and professionals. It is a veritable battleground, where insults fly from the human quiver, damaging lives, destroying self-esteem and a person&#39;s sense of self-worth.
Over the years, the way our customers shop our stores and websites has changed and will continue to change with the increasing popularity and convenience of smart phones and tablets.
Our initial idea with Stripe was that for people like us - those building apps and websites - it was incredibly difficult to take payments. So with an open mind, and maybe a useful lack of knowledge about the industry, we started building a payment product.
Social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr provide an unparalleled ability for people to stay connected in new and unique ways.
Expand the definition of &#39;reading&#39; to include non-fiction, humor, graphic novels, magazines, action adventure, and, yes, even websites. It&#39;s the pleasure of reading that counts; the focus will naturally broaden. A boy won&#39;t read shark books forever.
In an endless jungle of websites with text-based content, a beautiful image with a lot of space and colour can be like walking into a clearing. It&#39;s a relief.
I&#39;m not a gadget freak, so to say. I own an iPhone, which I love, and would sorely love to upgrade to MacBook Air from my current MacBook Pro. But what gets me going is the technology behind the gadgets, new websites, new apps. And I&#39;m way too much into social media - FB, Twitter and Instagram are always open on my phone.
I wanted to build a tool for my generation: people 20 to 40 who don&#39;t want to spend time balancing a checkbook or checking multiple financial institutions&#39; websites. Mint does just that, giving comprehensive, quick insights into a user&#39;s finances from their computer, mobile phone and/or tablet.
There are so many opportunities to learn things online, like between Coursera and Khan Academy and Duolingo. There are these awesome websites that are kind of these little personal Aristotles. There are times when I&#39;m preparing for a role of some kind, and then I&#39;ll focus on a certain subject.
I&#39;m on a strict gossip diet. No gossip websites, no gossip magazines. Otherwise, I find it paralyzing to exist.
I&#39;m a sucker for a sale. I don&#39;t understand why anyone wants to pay full price for anything because everything goes on sale. I love sale websites. In fact - this is almost kind of embarrassing - I&#39;m coming from an Isabel Marant sample sale.
I used to go on all these blogs and all these websites which I really don&#39;t like to go and read about at all, and I couldn&#39;t care less anymore.
Humshakals totally exist. In fact, I was on one of these social networking websites, and I noticed that there is this entire research done on Hollywood celebrities who look like each other.
The way I mainly use the Internet is keeping in touch with poets that live far away. My main interest is contemporary American poets and some Spanish language poets, and I keep in touch with their work through either their websites or email.
You can write whatever you want about me in websites and newspapers, but no one really knows me. They get the idea that I&#39;m a tough, heroic figure, but I&#39;m a sensitive pussycat.
While I have never learned to use a computer, I am surrounded by family and friends who carry information to me from blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and various websites.
As we all become increasingly reliant on social networking websites and new technologies to stay connected, it&#39;s important to remain cognizant of how private personal information and data is handled.
A lot of the websites built through the 1990s used Perl. The first webmaster of Sun Microsystems coined a wonderful phrase. He said Perl is the duck tape of the Internet - it&#39;s this language that people would write all these scripts that make things just work.
Only a few bloggers have the audience and credibility to effectively break stories, pressure the traditional media, incubate new ideas, or raise real money. These influential bloggers are usually sharp, opinionated, and focused on the world &#39;offline.&#39; They refuse to view events through the solipsistic blinders of their own websites.
Many artists stick to making and hire a manager to focus on their business. Artists that build websites and mobile apps can do that, too.

I use many different gadgets connected with computers; I use PCs, laptops and a Palm Pilot. I also use the Internet to visit websites, especially within Polish-language Internet. I usually go to political discussion groups and sites - of course, as I use my real name, people never believe that they are chatting with me!
When Usenet was eclipsed by websites in the late 1990s, people from that world - many of them programmers - wanted to bring the freewheeling, amazing discussions of Usenet to the web. And thus, RSS was born.
We rely on editors of blogs or websites and television stations to supply us these images, and the filter is becoming very thin and very porous. The ratings race for TV and websites is incredibly fierce, and one of the ways of getting people to watch is through graphic violent images.
One of the things I realized... is how few success stories there are in websites or products or businesses that exist primarily for an altruistic purpose.
I use computers for email, staying current with my own website as well as finding important information through other websites. I also use it for creating MP3 files of new music I&#39;m working on.
Websites are kind of useless. There&#39;s so much great web content and design out there, but the ways in which they are being experienced are not being maximized.
For me, Sci-Hub has a value by itself, as a website where users can access knowledge. There are many websites where you can see pictures, share tweets, download music, read ebooks. And Sci-Hub is a website where you can read research articles.
On the surface, public schools can seem egalitarian, especially with their websites&#39; emphasis on words such as &#39;connection,&#39; &#39;community,&#39; and &#39;choice.&#39; Yet despite this democratic vocabulary, money makes a big difference.
I have a horrible habit of buying merch tees. I go on people&#39;s websites and look at all their merch because I&#39;m interested in it, because we sell merch, too. And then, I always end up buying something.
PR and marketing doesn&#39;t sell books. It gets attention for them. It sends readers to bookstores and websites to read a few pages.
There&#39;s the idea that people should be able to control how the information that they&#39;re giving to websites is used and monetized in a more clear and powerful way. That&#39;s something that probably will need government action.
There are almost no other websites that have the type of readership we do.
I&#39;m a lover of fashion websites.
I think there is a difference between Slate and Salon. I think we both serve important functions on the Internet. As more and more Websites disappear, I&#39;m thankful Slate is still around because it makes things less lonely.
There are websites that any government wants to block. The truth about the Internet is that it&#39;s extremely hard to block anything - extremely hard. You&#39;ll never get perfect blocking.
I started Shutterstock out of my own need. I&#39;d previously created a few software companies, and each time, I struggled to find affordable images to use on my websites.
Companies like YouTube will continue to be tested on their commitment to the mission that made them such popular and profitable websites - providing an open platform to a wide range of ideas from around the world.

To tell you the truth, there are all these websites predicting my early death, and it&#39;s starting to work on me!

And that&#39;s the kind of thing people think, you know, that if you sign up to be a singer-songwriter you know how to deal with people setting up hate websites, or people being obsessed with you and crying when you touch them, but you don&#39;t, and you just have to deal with.
I&#39;ve been doing this 17 years but I can tell you I have more websites now than I have ever had devoted to me or my past career or my character. When I got this show, I think I had two fans out there that had created websites on my behalf.
Often when websites start running slowly, it&#39;s because they&#39;re under some form of attack.
On the Internet, news is consumed a la carte. If someone shows up on the main page of a website and doesn&#39;t see anything of interest, they leave. This negatively impacts ad revenues. The solution on the Internet is to pack news websites full of things that will draw people in, regardless of whether they are news or not.
A writers&#39; ring is where a group of four or five authors agree to promote each other&#39;s work on their own websites and via their social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter.

I don&#39;t know whether machine translation will eventually get good enough to allow us to browse people&#39;s websites in different languages so you can see how they live in different countries.
When an authoritarian regime starts taking down feeds and blocking websites just because we expose the truth... that&#39;s an attack on freedom of the press everywhere. When authoritarian regimes around the world start attacking journalists like that, we all have a problem.
The Internet&#39;s been so great, and it&#39;s so nice to have fans do nice, elaborate websites, but I think the downside is some of the things... for real fans to go on and see that 90 percent of the information isn&#39;t true or to see pictures that aren&#39;t really me.
Videos of Antifa violence, some of them doctored, are regularly shared on conservative, pro-Trump and conspiracy theory-pushing websites, often with commentary that suggests the media purposefully ignores those events. These videos often do not often include wider context or numbers.
The fame stuff, the kind words from websites and things, are very flattering and lovely, but I just wanna act.
Have you ever Googled yourself? I did, most depressing thing ever. People have websites hoping I die at 38.
The decentralized nature of online conversations often makes it easier to manipulate public opinion, both domestically and globally.
